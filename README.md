# Project 2

## Class Registration App

This is a web application built using Node JS, Express, and Handlebars. It incorporates both front- and back-end development and 
the use of a MySql database.

The goal of this app was to create a college class registration system, which allows students to sign up, log in, 
view available courses, register for and/or drop classes, and pay tuition.
